		<p>In my free time I usually do several activities, which "free my mind" from difficult tasks given to us in school.
		I would divide these activities into few categories, like sport, music, socialising and so on.
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Activities:</b>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Sport</b><br>In my nature I´m a sport type of a human being, because I enjoy rollerskating, playing hockey, badminton, ping-pong, tennis, pool, bowling, darts, calcetto, sometimes i work out and swim.</li>

			<li><b>Music</b><br>I love to play my favourite songs on my guitar. When I´m in the mood, I also sing. Occasionally I jam with my friends, who also have different types of musical instruments.</li>

			<li><b>Socialising</b><br>I´m social type of a person, friends are part of my life and that´s why I spend my time with them. We often hang out together and do lots of things like I´ve mentioned before - roller-skating, playing board games, computer games and we go out to our favourite places.</li>
